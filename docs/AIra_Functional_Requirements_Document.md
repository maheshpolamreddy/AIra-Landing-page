## 1. Purpose and scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This FRD defines **every user-facing and system-facing functional capability** of the Aɪra platform as implemented across two tightly coupled applications:

| Application | Package | Responsibility |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Landing** | `aira-landing-page-elite` | Marketing site, authentication UI, lead capture, AI counselor chat/TTS APIs, reverse-proxy into tutor SPA |
| **Tutor** | `ai-tutor` | Role-based learning product (student curriculum & competitive modes, teaching studio, teacher dashboard, admin weekly exams) |

### 1.2 In scope

- Public marketing pages, CTAs, waitlist, contact/demo
- Firebase authentication (email, social), password reset, role-based post-login routing
- Same-origin tutor proxy (`/student`, `/teacher`, `/admin`, `/dev`)
- Student mode selection, curriculum, competitive exams, AI teaching, dashboard, profile, settings
- Teacher dashboard (analytics UI)
- Admin dashboard and weekly exam scheduling
- Shared APIs: chat, TTS, waitlist, weekly exams bridge
- Demo personas (`/dev/demo-roles`)
- Data stores (Firestore, client Zustand, JSON/local fallbacks)

### 1.3 Out of scope for this document

- Detailed UI pixel specs / design system tokens (except where they affect function)
- Infrastructure runbooks beyond functional env dependencies
- Legal text content of Privacy/Terms (existence of pages is in scope)

### 1.4 Source of truth

Requirements below are **as-built**. Where UI suggests future capability (e.g. payments, HeyGen LiveAvatar, professional portal), it is called out in §16.

## 2. System overview

### 2.1 Architecture (logical)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Browser (same origin)                         │
│  localhost:3000 (dev)  |  landing Vercel host (prod)              │
├──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Next.js Landing App         │  Vite React Tutor SPA (rewritten) │
│  /  /login /signup /pricing  │  /student/*  /teacher/* /admin/*  │
│  /contact /assistant …       │  /dev/demo-roles                  │
│  /api/chat /api/tts …        │  Firebase Auth session (shared)   │
└──────────────┬───────────────┴────────────────┬─────────────────┘
               │                                │
               ▼                                ▼
     Groq · Sarvam · Firestore          AI providers (client)
     Firebase Auth                      Firestore (role, weekly exams)
```

### 2.2 Runtime model

| Environment | Landing | Tutor | How they connect |
|-------------|---------|-------|------------------|
| **Local** | Next.js `:3000` | Vite `:5173` | Landing rewrites tutor paths + Vite assets to `TUTOR_DEV_URL`; Vite proxies `/api` → landing |
| **Production** | Landing Vercel | `ai-ra-app.vercel.app` | `vercel.json` rewrites `/student*`, `/teacher*`, `/admin*`, `/dev*`, `/tutor-media*`, `/tutor-assets*` to tutor host |

**Critical functional rule:** Users should enter the product through the **landing origin**. Tutor Vite-imported assets use `server.origin` pointing at the landing host in local unified mode.

### 2.3 Technology summary

| Layer | Landing | Tutor |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 App Router, React 19 | Vite 6, React 18, React Router 6 |
| Auth / DB | Firebase Auth + Firestore | Same Firebase project (`aira-landingpage`) |
| State | React context (`AuthProvider`) | Zustand stores (persisted where noted) |
| Styling | Tailwind 4, Radix | Tailwind 3, Framer Motion |
| AI | Groq (server `/api/chat`) | Multi-provider client `aiService` |
| TTS | Sarvam (`/api/tts`) | Same `/api/tts` via proxy |
| 3D / media | Local counselor video | Three.js / R3F, mascot video, diagram SVGs |

---

## 3. Actors and personas

| Actor ID | Actor | Description | Primary entry |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **A-VIS** | Visitor | Unauthenticated visitor browsing marketing | `/` |
| **A-STU** | Student | Authenticated learner (default role) | `/student/mode-selection` |
| **A-TCH** | Teacher | Authenticated educator | `/teacher/dashboard` |
| **A-ADM** | Admin | Platform administrator (Firestore role only; not self-serve signup) | `/admin/dashboard` |
| **A-DEM** | Demo user | Local persona without Firebase (DEV or admin gate) | `/dev/demo-roles` |
| **A-SYS** | System | Schedulers, bridges, proxies, AI providers | N/A |

### 3.1 Role assignment rules

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **R-ROLE-01** | Public signup may select `student` or `teacher` only. |
| **R-ROLE-02** | `admin` cannot be self-assigned on signup; must be set out-of-band in Firestore `users/{uid}.role`. |
| **R-ROLE-03** | OAuth / social signup must preserve an existing elevated role (`preserveExistingRole`). |
| **R-ROLE-04** | Default role on ambiguity / new user = `student`. |
| **R-ROLE-05** | Tutor enforces path prefix vs role via `RoleGuard` (`/student` ↔ student, etc.). |

## 5. End-to-end journeys

### 5.1 E2E-01 — Visitor discovers product and starts free trial

```
Visit `/`
  → Review Hero / Features / Courses / How it works
  → CTA “Start Free Trial” → `/signup`
  → Create account (name, email, role student|teacher, DOB, password)
     OR social login
  → Firestore `users/{uid}` written
  → Full-page navigate to role home:
        student → `/student/mode-selection`
        teacher → `/teacher/dashboard`
```

**Success:** Authenticated user lands inside tutor SPA under correct role prefix with Firebase session active.

### 5.2 E2E-02 — Returning user login with deep link

```
Unauthenticated hit on `/student/curriculum`
  → Tutor `ProtectedRoute` → landing `/login?redirect=/student/curriculum`
  → User authenticates
  → `goAfterAuth` sanitizes redirect (same-origin tutor paths only)
  → User arrives at `/student/curriculum`
```

**Success:** Post-login destination respects safe `redirect` param; unsafe redirects fall back to role home.

### 5.3 E2E-03 — Student curriculum learning path

```
`/student/mode-selection` → Enter Curriculum
  → `/student/curriculum` (grades)
  → Select grade → subjects → chapters/topics
  → Open topic → `/student/learn/:topicId`
  → AI masterclass steps + diagrams + TTS
  → Optional: raise doubt → verification quiz
  → Studio: generate notes / mind map / flashcards / quiz / summary
  → Export PDF/DOCX/PNG
  → Progress recorded (curriculum + analytics stores)
  → Optional return via Dashboard `/student/dashboard`
```

### 5.4 E2E-04 — Student competitive exam path

```
`/student/mode-selection` → Enter Competitive
  → `/student/competitive?section=exams` (default Available Exams)
  → Choose exam → subject → paper
  → Live exam (timer, palette, mark-for-review, bookmarks)
  → Result + analytics updated in `competitiveStore`
  → Optional: Weekly Tests (published Sat/Sun window)
  → Optional: Topic Quizzes / PYQs / Mock / Questionary → `/student/competitive-explain`
```

### 5.5 E2E-05 — Book a demo / contact

```
`/` or `/contact` → Contact form
  → Write Firestore `contact_messages`
  → Confirmation to user
```

### 5.6 E2E-06 — Professional course waitlist

```
`/` Courses → Professional track (unavailable)
  → Notify Me / Coming Soon modal
  → `POST /api/waitlist` → Firestore `waitlist`
```

### 5.7 E2E-07 — AI counselor assist

```
Home floating assistant OR `/assistant`
  → User chats → `POST /api/chat` (SSE stream)
  → Optional speak → `POST /api/tts` (Sarvam WAV)
```

### 5.8 E2E-08 — Teacher monitors class (current as-built)

```
Login as teacher → `/teacher/dashboard`
  → View mock class performance / student list
  → Open settings/profile
```

### 5.9 E2E-09 — Admin publishes weekly exam

```
Login as admin → `/admin/weekly-exams`
  → Create/edit session (Saturday/Sunday, mock|pyq, times IST)
  → Publish
  → Student sees session in Competitive → Weekly Tests when window active
  → Fallback chain: Firestore ↔ `/api/weekly-exams` ↔ JSON ↔ localStorage
```

### 5.10 E2E-10 — Sign-out across apps

```
Tutor logout OR landing profile menu
  → Firebase `signOut`
  → Clear role hint
  → Landing `/login?signedOut=1` (forces clean session when coming from tutor)
```

### 5.11 E2E-11 — Demo personas (QA / sales)

```
DEV build OR admin → `/dev/demo-roles`
  → Enter Student / Teacher / Admin demo
  → Local `isDemo` session (no Firebase) into role home
```
