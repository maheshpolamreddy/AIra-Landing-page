### 1.1 Repositories covered

| Application | Package name | Path audited | Evidence |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Landing (marketing + auth + APIs) | `aira-landing-page-elite` | `…/Downloads/AIra landing page` | `package.json` |
| Tutor (role-based learning SPA) | `ai-tutor` `1.0.0` | `…/OneDrive/Desktop/AIra Project/Project` | `package.json` |

This FRD treats the two packages as **one product** delivered on a shared origin via path rewrites. Statements cite which app owns the behavior.

### 1.2 Evidence standard

- Every functional requirement is intended to be verifiable in code, config, or comments.
- Items that could not be fully verified are marked **`[ASSUMPTION]`** or **`[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]`**.
- No secret values are included — environment variable **names only**.

---

## 2. Purpose & Scope

### 2.1 Purpose

Define testable functional behavior of the Aɪra product as implemented: marketing site, authentication, API services, and the student/teacher/admin learning application.

### 2.2 In scope

- Landing App Router pages and client auth flows
- Landing API routes under `/api/*`
- Tutor React Router routes, guards, and role homes
- Firestore collections written or read by either app
- Client persistence (Zustand, localStorage, sessionStorage)
- Third-party integrations referenced in code
- Same-origin tutor reverse-proxy configuration

### 2.3 Out of scope

- Visual design specifications beyond functional UI presence
- Operational runbooks and incident response
- Legal accuracy of Privacy/Terms copy (page existence is in scope)
- Uncommitted local-only experiments not present in the audited trees

| **Landing** | Next.js App Router package `aira-landing-page-elite` |
| **Tutor** | Vite React SPA package `ai-tutor` |
| **SPA** | Single-page application (tutor) |
| **Role home** | Default post-auth path for a role (`lib/auth-redirect.ts` / tutor `homeForRole`) |
| **Mode selection** | Student screen choosing Curriculum vs Competitive (`/student/mode-selection`) |

## 4. Actors / User Roles

| Actor ID | Role | How assigned (code) | Default destination |
|----------|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **A-VIS** | Visitor (unauthenticated) | No session | Landing public pages |
| **A-STU** | `student` | Signup default; Firestore `users/{uid}.role`; OAuth defaults to student | `/student/mode-selection` (or remembered student home) |
| **A-TCH** | `teacher` | Signup role select; Firestore role | `/teacher/dashboard` |
| **A-ADM** | `admin` | **Not** self-assignable on public signup (`saveUserProfile` forces non-admin); must exist on Firestore profile | `/admin/dashboard` |
| **A-DEM** | Demo user | Tutor `enter*Demo()`; gate: `import.meta.env.DEV` **or** authenticated admin | Role home for chosen demo |
| **A-SYS** | System / integrations | N/A | Groq, Sarvam, Firebase, rewrite targets |

**Type source:** `AppRole = 'student' | 'teacher' | 'admin'` — landing `lib/auth-redirect.ts`; tutor mirrors role strings in guards/stores.

---

## 5. Assumptions & Constraints

| ID | Statement | Tag |
|----|-----------|-----|
| **AC-01** | Production users access tutor paths on the **landing hostname**, which rewrites to `https://ai-ra-app.vercel.app` per `vercel.json`. | Verified config |
| **AC-02** | Local unified mode requires landing on port **3000** and tutor on **5173**, with landing rewrites and Vite `/api` proxy. | Verified config |
| **AC-03** | Firebase project id used in client config is shared across apps (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` / `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`). | `[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]` that both env files always point to the same project in every environment |
| **AC-04** | No automated unit/E2E test files (`*.test.*` / `*.spec.*`) were found in either audited repo; acceptance relies on manual checks unless tests exist elsewhere. | Verified absence in repos |
| **AC-05** | Teacher/admin dashboard metrics are driven by `src/data/mockAnalytics.ts` (tutor), not live Firestore aggregates. | Verified imports |
| **AC-06** | Landing `POST/GET /api/weekly-exams` persists to JSON/memory store (`lib/weekly-exam-store.ts`), while tutor primary path uses Firestore collection `weeklyExamSchedules` with API/localStorage fallbacks. Dual-write consistency is not guaranteed by a single transaction. | Verified; dual-store risk |
| **AC-07** | `[ASSUMPTION]` Hardcoded weekly bridge fallback secret string in landing API is for local/dev resilience; production should set `WEEKLY_EXAM_BRIDGE_SECRET`. | Code contains fallback — ops policy unconfirmed |
| **AC-08** | Professional learning “portal” URL `https://aira-edtech-f063e.web.app/` is referenced for `intent=professional` login redirect (`lib/site.ts`); primary nav still uses Coming Soon waitlist UX. | Verified code paths diverge by entry point |

---

## 6. System Overview / Architecture Summary

### 6.1 Applications

| App | Runtime | Hosting (as configured) |
|-----|---------|-------------------------|
| Landing | Next.js **16.1.6**, React 19, App Router | Vercel (project deploys this package) |
| Tutor | Vite **6**, React 18, React Router 6 | Vercel project `ai-ra-app` (`https://ai-ra-app.vercel.app`) |

### 6.2 Connection model

```
Browser → Landing origin
            ├─ Landing pages + /api/*
            └─ Rewrites:
                 /student|/teacher|/admin|/dev|/tutor-media|/tutor-assets|/theme-boot.js
                 → Tutor host (prod) or TUTOR_DEV_URL (dev)

Tutor (direct :5173) → proxies /api → landing :3000 (vite.config.ts)
```

**Evidence:** `next.config.mjs` (dev rewrites), `vercel.json` (prod rewrites), `vite.config.ts` (`server.proxy['/api']`).

### 6.3 Auth session model

- Firebase Auth client SDK on both apps.
- Landing owns login/signup UI.
- Tutor `FirebaseAuthBridge` syncs `onAuthStateChanged` into Zustand `authStore`.
- Cross-app hints: `localStorage` keys `aira:role`, `aira:student-home` (landing `lib/session-hints.ts`, tutor `src/lib/sessionHints.ts`).

## 10. API Requirements

| ID | Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Auth | Side effects |
|----|--------|----------|---------|------|--------------|
| **API-001** | POST | `/api/chat` | Stream counselor chat completion | None | Outbound Groq chat completions |
| **API-002** | POST | `/api/tts` | Synthesize speech audio | None | Outbound Sarvam TTS |

**Notes**

- No Zod schemas in landing API routes; validation is manual.
- Tutor also ships serverless files under tutor `api/` for some routes when deployed standalone — **`[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]`** which deployment mode is authoritative in production (landing rewrite vs tutor direct). Same-origin production architecture implies landing APIs for browser calls on landing host.
- Tutor code references `API_ROUTES.chat` / `waitlist` / `tts/health` but **fetch usage found only for** `/api/tts` and `/api/weekly-exams`.

## 14. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| **NFR-001** | Protected tutor routes shall not render primary content before `authReady` / hydration completes. | Must | Guard components |
| **NFR-002** | Landing auth domain middleware shall complete redirect without requiring login. | Must | Loopback fix only |
| **NFR-003** | Chat API shall run on Node runtime with configured `maxDuration` of 30 seconds (as set on route). | Should | `app/api/chat/route.ts` |
| **NFR-004** | Tutor production build shall emit code-split vendor chunks (react/three/ui/pdf) per Vite config. | Should | `vite.config.ts` `manualChunks` |
| **NFR-005** | Accessibility settings that set document data attributes (font size, high contrast, reduce motion) shall apply without a full remount of the app shell. | Should | Settings page + store subscribers |
| **NFR-006** | Primary student flows shall be usable on mobile and desktop viewports. | Should | `[ASSUMPTION]` responsive CSS exists; no automated visual regression suite found |
| **NFR-007** | Secrets for landing Groq/Sarvam shall remain server-side (`GROQ_API_KEY`, `SARVAM_API_KEY`). | Must | Not `NEXT_PUBLIC_` |
| **NFR-008** | Tutor AI provider keys are `VITE_*` and therefore shipped to the browser — treat as public. | Must (constraint) | Security design debt; not a claim of secrecy |
| **NFR-009** | Open redirects via login `redirect` param shall be blocked by allow-list sanitization. | Must | `sanitizeAppRedirect` |
| **NFR-010** | i18n framework is initialized with an English resource bundle; UI language options beyond English are limited as implemented. | Could | `src/i18n.ts` |

---

## 15. Out of Scope / Not Implemented

| Item | Evidence | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Payment checkout / Stripe / Razorpay | Pricing CTAs → signup/contact; “Placeholder pricing” copy | Not implemented |
| HeyGen LiveAvatar runtime | SDK in landing `package.json`; no imports; unused `HEYGEN_API_KEY` | Not implemented |
| Firestore `leads` collection writers | Rules only; waitlist used instead | Not implemented |
| Landing middleware auth gating | Explicitly absent | Not implemented (by design) |
| Tutor native primary login UI | Redirects to landing | Not productized |
| Live teacher content authoring routes | No routes in `App.tsx` | Not implemented |
| Live teacher/admin analytics backend | `mockAnalytics.ts` | Placeholder data |
| Automated test suite in repos | Zero `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` files found | Not present |
| Blog CMS | Coming soon page | Placeholder |
| Careers hiring system | Placeholder email | Placeholder |
| Tutor fetches to `/api/chat`, `/api/waitlist`, `/api/tts/health` | Constants only; no call sites found | Unused client wiring |
| Auth store stub Google/Apple/password-reset delays | Fake timers / no-ops in tutor `authStore` (landing owns real social) | Legacy/stub |
| Roll-number login | Present in store; commented as not exposed in UI | Unused UX |

- [ ] Teacher signup lands on `/teacher/dashboard`
- [ ] Public signup cannot create `admin` role
- [ ] Unsafe `redirect` query is ignored
- [ ] Role-mismatched `redirect` is ignored in favor of role home
- [ ] Tutor protected route redirects to landing login when logged out
- [ ] `signedOut=1` clears session on login page

### Student
- [ ] Mode selection navigates to curriculum and competitive and stores home hint
- [ ] Curriculum grades include 6–10 and 11–12 science ids
- [ ] Topic opens `/student/learn/:topicId`
- [ ] Competitive sections switch via `?section=`
- [ ] Exam attempt reaches result and records competitive attempt
- [ ] Settings tabs match role filter rules

### Teacher
